## Human-Driven Binary Image Features distance

_Equal error rate 0.11% at similarity threshold 0.64_

- Program some extraction method (by default that is
LBP based on the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1017623) within IrisRecognition.py,
function `extractIBBCode`. Make sure to find and set
optimal parameters.

- Program comparison of computed codes within
IrisRecognition.py, function `matchIBBCodes`.

- List the core (LBP) improvements (parts you implemented/optimized) in the comments on top of the
`extractIBBCode` function.
